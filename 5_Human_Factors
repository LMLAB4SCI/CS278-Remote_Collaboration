In remote collaboration contexts, the users should be able
to interact with the remote collaborators in different places
both effectively and efficiently for best task performance.
However, the overall user experience regarding their feeling
of ease of communication, understanding of the other users’
emotional states, the sense of social/co-presence and comfort
is also important to evaluate when considering the effectiveness
of the collaboration systems. Thus, while developing
novel interfaces and effective tools for remote collaborations,
human factors research to understand perception, cognition,
and behavior with the technology should be conducted and
supported.
Researchers have actively studied how visual cues and
tools of sharing a task space influence the collaborators’
sense of social/co-presence and cognitive load during the collaboration.
For instance, Kim et al. [28] conducted a study
that investigated the effects of augmented visual cues on the
user-perceived co-presence with the remote user. Piumsomboon
et al. [43] compared different sharing viewmodes, such
as shoulder-mounted or hand-held camera views, and found
that users generally preferred the shoulder-mounted view
and reported a higher level of co-presence when there was a
shared view. Regarding the effects of visual cues, Huang et
al. [15] found that local and remote users have lower cognitive
load during a remote collaboration when they had more
visual communication cues available. More recently, Dey et
al. [5] studied the effect of sharing the user’s physiological
signalswith the remote users, such as heart beat as a signal for
representing the user’s emotional state, and found a positive
influence for emotional experience in a gaming context.
