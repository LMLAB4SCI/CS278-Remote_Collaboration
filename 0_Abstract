Remote collaboration has been studied formore than two decades and now there is the possibilities for new types of collaboration
with the recent advances in immersive technologies such as Virtual, Augmented, Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR). However,
despite the increasing research interest in remote collaboration study with VR/AR/MR technologies, there is still a lack of
academic venues specifically focusing on VR/AR/MR remote collaboration research. This special issue provides high-quality
papers on the topic of remote collaboration research and increases visibility of this timely interesting and important research
area.We particularly focus on three research aspects in remote collaboration: (1) use of multimodal communication cues, (2)
awareness of the task space, and (3) human factors understanding. In this editorial, we first describe five essential factors for
remote collaboration: task, local user, remote user, communication, and tool/interface, and then summarize a brief history of
the research areas. We also cover the feature papers accepted in this issue, which introduce novel multimodal interfaces for
remote collaboration and the effects on task performance and perceptual factors. Finally, we discuss some potential future
research directions while concluding the editorial.
